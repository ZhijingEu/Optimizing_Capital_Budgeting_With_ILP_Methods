To run the XLSM model, you will need to load at bare minimum Excel's Solver Add-In https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/load-the-solver-add-in-in-excel-612926fc-d53b-46b4-872c-e24772f078ca but also the other tools (Open Solver , Solver Studio etc) - links are in the file labelled Capital_Budgeting_Optimisation_v02.xlsm

To run the Python examples, you will need to install PulP https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/main and Pyomo https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/ libraries.
